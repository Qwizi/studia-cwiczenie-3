# Task 3 DSW: Program for Calculating Exchange Rate Differences

This program is designed to calculate differences in exchange rates.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Poetry
- Git

### Installation

1. **Install Poetry**: [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) is a tool for dependency management and packaging in Python. You can use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/installation/) to install it globally, which is recommended.

    ```shell
    pipx install poetry
    ```

2. **Clone the repository**: This will create a copy of this project on your local machine.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Qwizi/task3-dsw
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**: Navigate into the cloned project's directory and install the necessary dependencies.

    ```shell
    cd task3-dsw
    poetry install
    ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment and install pre-commit hooks**: This step ensures that the hooks are installed and active.

    ```shell
    poetry shell
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```

## Usage

After following the installation steps, you can start using the program to calculate exchange rate differences. (Provide instructions on how to use the program here)
